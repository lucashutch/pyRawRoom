## Features

### Core Functionality
-   **Non-destructive Editing**: Edits are stored in JSON sidecar files (`.xmp`) alongside the original RAW files.
-   **RAW Image Processing**: Adjustments for exposure, contrast, blacks, whites, shadows, highlights, sharpening, and de-noise.

### UI Editor (`pyneg-ui`)
A graphical user interface (GUI) for interactively editing RAW files.
-   **Interactive Editing**: Live preview of changes as adjustments are made.
-   **Comprehensive Adjustments**: Sliders for fine-tuning exposure, contrast, blacks, whites, shadows, highlights, sharpening, and de-noise.
-   **Zoom Support**: Zoom into photos for precise control during editing.
-   **Responsive Sliders**: Optimized performance for smooth slider interactions.
-   **Quick Reset**: Double-click sliders to reset them to their default values.
-   **Image Carousel**: Horizontal carousel for easy navigation through images in a folder.
-   **Integrated Rating System**: Assign star ratings (1-5) to photos directly within the editor.
-   **Dynamic Carousel Sync**: Editor's image carousel automatically updates and synchronizes with gallery filters.

### Gallery View
-   **Grid Browsing**: Browse images in a folder in a responsive grid layout.
-   **Star Rating Display**: View assigned star ratings for each image thumbnail.
-   **Rating-based Filtering**: Filter displayed images by star rating (match, greater than, or less than a specified rating).

## Development
